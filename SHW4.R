#In the Spring of 2020, the Covid-19 strain of coronaviruses led to a worldwide pandemic. Today we will practice computing probabilities. The incubation period of a disease is the amount of time between contracting the disease and showing symptoms. Here, I am calling the "illness period" the amount of time between showing symptoms and being ready to interact in public again. For Covid-19, the population statistics are
#incubation period: mean = 8 days, standard deviation = 3 days
#illness period: mean = 4 days, standard deviation = 2 days
#Since there have been thousands of cases worldwide, assume a normal distribution for the calculations.
